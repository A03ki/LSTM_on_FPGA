RNN4HLS
===

This project can use a trained RNN-model in PyTorch on C language for High-Level Synthesis.

## Description
This project has one-way LSTM.  
Sorry, this project only take inference process.

## Demo
You can try to run this sample code "RNN4HLS/sample/sin_wave_inf.ipynb" on Jupyter Notebook.

## Licence
